<p align=center><i>And you think you're so clever and classless and free</i></p>
<p align=center>&#151; John Lennon</p>
<p><a href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript">JavaScript</a> is a <i>class-free</i>, object-oriented language, and as such,
it uses prototypal inheritance instead of classical inheritance. This can be
puzzling to programmers trained  in  conventional object-oriented languages
like C++ and Java. JavaScript's prototypal inheritance  has more expressive
power than classical inheritance, as we will see presently.</p>

<p>But first, why do we care about inheritance at all? There are primarily two
reasons. The first is type convenience. We want the language system to
automatically <i>cast</i> references of similar classes. Little type-safety is
obtained from a type system which requires the routine explicit  casting of
object references. This is of critical importance in strongly-typed languages,
but it is irrelevant in loosely-typed languages like JavaScript, where object
references  never need casting.</p>
<p>The second reason is code reuse. It is very common to have a quantity of objects
  all implementing exactly the same methods. Classes make it possible to create
  them all from a single set of definitions. It is also common to have objects
  that are similar to some other objects, but differing only in the addition or
  modification of a small number of methods. Classical inheritance is useful for
  this but prototypal inheritance is even more useful. </p>
<p>To demonstrate this, we will introduce a little <a href="#sugar">sugar</a>
  which will let us write in a style that resembles a conventional classical language.
  We will then show useful patterns which are not available in classical languages.
  Then finally, we will explain the <a href="#sugar">sugar</a>. </p>
<h2>Classical Inheritance</h2>
<p>First, we will make a <tt>Parenizor</tt> class that will have  set and get
methods for its <tt>value</tt>, and a <tt>toString</tt> method that will wrap
the <tt>value</tt> in parens. </p>
<pre>function Parenizor(value) {
    this.setValue(value);
}

Parenizor.method('setValue', function (value) {
    this.value = value;
    return this;
});

Parenizor.method('getValue', function () {
    return this.value;
});

Parenizor.method('toString', function () {
    return '(' + this.getValue() + ')';
});
</pre>
<p>The syntax is a little unusual, but it is easy to recognize the classical
pattern in it. The <tt>method</tt> method takes a method name and a function,
adding them to the class as a public method.</p>
<p>So now we can write</p>
<pre>myParenizor = new Parenizor(0);
myString = myParenizor.toString();</pre>
<p>As you would expect, <tt>myString</tt> is <tt>&quot;(0)&quot;</tt>.</p>
<p>Now we will make another class which will inherit from <tt>Parenizor</tt>,
which is  the same except that its <tt>toString</tt> method will
produce <tt>&quot;-0-&quot;</tt> if the <tt>value</tt> is zero or empty.</p>
<pre>function ZParenizor(value) {
    this.setValue(value);
}

ZParenizor.inherits(Parenizor);

ZParenizor.method('toString', function () {
    if (this.getValue()) {
        return this.uber('toString');
    }
    return &quot;-0-&quot;;
});
</pre>
<p>The <tt>inherits</tt> method is similar to Java's <tt>extends</tt>.
The <tt>uber</tt> method is similar to Java's <tt>super</tt>. It lets a method
call a method of  the parent class. (The names have been changed to avoid
reserved word restrictions.)</p>
<p>So now we can write</p>
<pre>myZParenizor = new ZParenizor(0);
myString = myZParenizor.toString();</pre>
<p>This time, <tt>myString</tt> is <tt>&quot;-0-&quot;</tt>.</p>
<p>JavaScript does not have classes, but we can program as though it does.</p>
<h2>Multiple Inheritance</h2>
<p>By manipulating a function's <tt>prototype</tt> object, we can implement
multiple inheritance, allowing us to make a class built from the methods of
multiple classes.  Promiscuous multiple inheritance can be difficult to
implement and can potentially suffer from method name collisions. We could
implement promiscuous multiple inheritance in JavaScript, but for this example
we will use a more disciplined form
called <i><a href="http://www.cosmik.com/aa-october99/stan_freberg.html">Swiss
Inheritance</a></i>.</p>
<p>Suppose there is a <tt>NumberValue</tt> class that has a <tt>setValue</tt>
method that checks that the <tt>value</tt> is a number in a certain range,
throwing an exception if necessary. We only want
its <tt>setValue</tt> and <tt>setRange</tt> methods for our <tt>ZParenizor</tt>.
We certainly don't want its <tt>toString</tt> method. So, we write</p>
<pre>ZParenizor.swiss(NumberValue, 'setValue', 'setRange');</pre>
<p>This adds only the requested methods to our class.</p>
<h2>Parasitic Inheritance</h2>
<p>There is another way to write <tt>ZParenizor</tt>. Instead of inheriting
from <tt>Parenizor</tt>, we write a constructor that calls
the <tt>Parenizor</tt> constructor, passing off the result as its own.
And instead of adding public methods,  the constructor adds  <a href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript/private.html">privileged methods</a>.</p>
<pre>function ZParenizor2(value) {
    var that = new Parenizor(value);
    that.toString = function () {
        if (this.getValue()) {
            return this.uber('toString');
        }
        return &quot;-0-&quot;
    };
    return that;
}
</pre>
<p>Classical inheritance is about the <i>is-a</i> relationship, and parasitic
  inheritance is about the <i>was-a-but-now's-a</i> relationship. The constructor
  has a larger role in the construction of the object. Notice that the <tt>uber</tt>
  n&eacute;e <tt>super</tt> method is still available to the privileged methods. </p>
<h2>Class Augmentation</h2>
<p>JavaScript's dynamism allows us to add or replace methods of an existing class.
  We can call the <tt>method</tt> method at any time, and all present and future
  instances of the class will have that method. We can literally extend a class
  at any time. Inheritance works retroactively. We call this <i>Class Augmentation</i>
  to avoid confusion with Java's <tt>extends</tt>, which means something else.</p>
<h2>Object Augmentation</h2>
<p>In the static object-oriented languages, if you want an object which is slightly
  different than another object, you need to define a new class. In JavaScript,
  you can add methods to individual objects without the need for additional classes.
  This has enormous power because you can write far fewer classes and the classes
  you do write can be much simpler. Recall that JavaScript objects are like hashtables.
  You can add new values at any time. If the value is a function, then it becomes
  a method. </p>
<p>So in the example above, I didn't need a <tt>ZParenizor</tt> class at all.
I could have simply modified my instance.</p>
<pre>myParenizor = new Parenizor(0);
myParenizor.toString = function () {
    if (this.getValue()) {
        return this.uber('toString');
    }
    return &quot;-0-&quot;;
};
myString = myParenizor.toString();</pre>
<p>We added a <tt>toString</tt> method to our <tt>myParenizor</tt> instance without
  using any form of inheritance. We can evolve individual instances because the
  language is class-free. </p>
<h2 id=sugar>Sugar</h2>
<p>To make the examples above work, I wrote four <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">sugar</a>
  methods. First, the <tt>method</tt> method, which adds an instance method to
  a class. </p>
<pre>Function.prototype.method = function (name, func) {
    this.prototype[name] = func;
    return this;
};</pre>
<p>This adds a public method to the <tt>Function.prototype</tt>, so all
functions get it by Class Augmentation. It takes a name and a function, and
adds them to a function's <tt>prototype</tt> object. </p>
<p>It returns <tt>this</tt>. When I write a method that doesn't need to return
  a value, I usually have it return <tt>this</tt>. It allows for a cascade-style
  of programming. </p>
<p>Next comes the <tt>inherits</tt> method, which indicates that one class inherits
  from another. It should be called after both classes are defined, but before
  the inheriting class's methods are added. </p>
<pre>
Function.method('inherits', function (parent) {
    this.prototype = new parent();
    var d = {}, 
        p = this.prototype;
    this.prototype.constructor = parent; 
    this.method('uber', function uber(name) {
        if (!(name in d)) {
            d[name] = 0;
        }        
        var f, r, t = d[name], v = parent.prototype;
        if (t) {
            while (t) {
                v = v.constructor.prototype;
                t -= 1;
            }
            f = v[name];
        } else {
            f = p[name];
            if (f == this[name]) {
                f = v[name];
            }
        }
        d[name] += 1;
        r = f.apply(this, Array.prototype.slice.apply(arguments, [1]));
        d[name] -= 1;
        return r;
    });
    return this;
});</pre>
<p>Again, we augment <tt>Function</tt>. We make an instance of the
<tt>parent</tt> class and use it as the new <tt>prototype</tt>. We also
correct the <tt>constructor</tt> field, and we add the <tt>uber</tt> method to
the <tt>prototype</tt> as well.</p>
<p>The <tt>uber</tt> method looks for the named method in its own <tt>prototype</tt>.
  This is the function to invoke in the case of Parasitic Inheritance or Object
  Augmentation. If we are doing Classical Inheritance, then we need to find the
  function in the <tt>parent</tt>'s <tt>prototype</tt>. The <tt>return</tt> statement
  uses the function's <tt>apply</tt> method to invoke the function, explicitly
  setting <tt>this</tt> and passing an array of parameters. The parameters (if
  any) are obtained from the <tt>arguments</tt> array. Unfortunately, the
  <tt>arguments</tt>
  array is not a true array, so we have to use <tt>apply</tt> again to invoke
  the array <tt>slice</tt> method. </p>
<p>Finally, the <tt>swiss</tt> method.</p>
<pre>Function.method('swiss', function (parent) {
    for (var i = 1; i &lt; arguments.length; i += 1) {
        var name = arguments[i];
        this.prototype[name] = parent.prototype[name];
    }
    return this;
});</pre>
<p>The <tt>swiss</tt> method loops through the <tt>arguments</tt>.
For each <tt>name</tt>, it copies a member from the <tt>parent</tt>'s
<tt>prototype</tt> to the new class's <tt>prototype</tt>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>JavaScript can be used like a classical language, but it also has a level of
  expressiveness which is quite unique. We have looked at Classical Inheritance,
  Swiss Inheritance, Parasitic Inheritance, Class Augmentation, and Object Augmentation.
  This large set of code reuse patterns comes from a language which is considered
  smaller and simpler than Java. </p>
<p>Classical objects are hard. The only way to add a new member to a hard object is to create a new class. In JavaScript, objects are soft. A new member can be added to a soft object by simple assignment.</p>
<p>Because objects in JavaScript are so flexible, you will want to think 
  differently about class hierarchies. Deep hierarchies are inappropriate. 
  Shallow hierarchies are efficient and expressive.</p>
<p style="border: 2px solid black; padding: 1em;"> I have been writing JavaScript 
  for 8 years now, and I have never once found need to use an <code>uber</code> 
  function. The <var>super</var> idea is fairly important in the classical 
  pattern, but it appears to be unnecessary in the prototypal and functional 
  patterns. I now see my early attempts to support the classical model in 
  JavaScript as a mistake.</p>
